Given an array arr[] of N weights. Find the least weight capacity of a boat to ship all weights within D days.
Note: You have to load weights on the ship in the given order.

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1, 2, 1}
D = 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
We can ship the weights in 2 days
in the following way:-
Day 1- 1,2
Day 2- 1
Example 2:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {9, 8, 10}
D = 3
Output:
10
Explanation:
We can ship the weights in 3 days
in the following way:-
Day 1- 9
Day 2- 8
Day 3- 10
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function leastWeightCapacity() which takes 2 integers N, and D, and an array arr of size N as input and returns the least weight capacity of the boat required.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N*log(Sum of weights - max(list of weights))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Codes Are:-
int leastWeightCapacity(int arr[], int N, int D) {
       int l = 0, r = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
            l = max(l, arr[i]);
            r += arr[i];
        }
     
        
        
        //cout<<r<<endl;
        
        int res = r;
        while(l <= r) {
            int cap = (l+r)/2;
            
            int days = 1, temp = 0;
            for(int i=0; i<N; i++) {
                temp += arr[i];
                if(temp > cap) {
                    temp = arr[i];
                    days++;
                }
            }
            if(days <= D) {
                res = cap;
                r = cap-1;
            }
            else l = cap+1;
        }
        
        return res;
    }

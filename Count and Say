Thsi Is My First Program in LeetCode and GFG Protal.
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
Example 2:

Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"


Codes is:-
string nextSay(string str) {
        string res;
        for(int i=0; i < str.size(); i++) {
            char c = str[i];
            int count = 0;
            for(int j=i; i < str.size(); j++) {
                if(str[j] == c)
                    count++;
                else {
                    i = j-1;
                    break;
                }
            }
            res += to_string(count);
            res.push_back(c);
        }
        return res;
    }
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string res = "1";
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            res = nextSay(res);
        }
        
        return res;
    }

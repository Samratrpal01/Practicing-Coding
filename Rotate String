Given a string S of size N and Q queries.Each query is either of the following types:
Type 1- Rotate the string by K character from the end.
Type 2- Print the character at the I'th index of the resulting string at that instant.
Answer all queries.

Example 1:

Input:
N=7 Q=5
S=abcdefg
Query1: Type=1 K=2
Query2: Type=2 I=0
Query3: Type=2 I=6
Query4: Type=1 K=4
Query5: Type=2 I=1
Output:
f
e
c
Explanation:
After First query String becomes-"fgabcde"
Second query returns - 'f'
Third query returns -'e'
After Fourth Query String becomes-"bcdefga"
Fifth Query returns -'c'
Example 2:

Input:
N=5 Q=2
S=geeks
Query1: Type=1 K=4
Query2: Type=2 I=4
Output:
g
Explanation:
After first query,string becomes "eeksg".
Second query returns 'g'.
Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function StringQuery() which takes an integer N,an integer Q, a string S and two arrays Q1 and Q2(containing Query type and K/I respectively) and returns an array containing the answers to the queries.

Expected Time Complexity:O(Q)
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)

Codes Are:-
 vector<char> StringQuery(int N, int Q, string S, int Q1[], int Q2[]) {
       int ans=0;
       vector<char>res;
       for(auto i=0;i<Q;i++)
       {
           if(Q1[i]==1)
            ans+=N-(Q2[i])%N;
            
            else
                res.push_back(S[(Q2[i]+ans)%N]);
                
       }
       
       return res;
       
    }

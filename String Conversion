Given two strings X and Y, the task is to check if it is possible to convert X to Y by performing the following operations.

 Make some lowercase letters uppercase.
 Delete all the lowercase letters.
Example 1:

Input: X = "daBcd", Y = "ABC"
Output: 1
Explanation: Convert 'a' and 'c', delete
both the d's
Example 2:

Input: X = "ABcd", Y = "BCD"
Output: 0
Explanation: Can not delete A
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function stringConversion() which takes the strings as input and returns 1 if it is possible to convert, otherwise 0.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|X|*|Y|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|X|*|Y|)

Codes Are:-
int stringConversion(string X, string Y)
	{
		// calculates length
		int n = X.length();
		int m = Y.length();

		int dp[n + 1][m + 1];
		for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
				dp[i][j] = 0;
			}
		}
		
		dp[0][0] = 1;

		for (int i = 0; i < X.length(); i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j <= Y.length(); j++) {

			
				if (dp[i][j]) {

					
					if (j < Y.length() && 
						(toupper(X[i]) == Y[j]))
						dp[i + 1][j + 1] = 1;

					
					if (!isupper(X[i]))
						dp[i + 1][j] = 1;
				}
			}
		}

		return (dp[n][m]);
	}

Given a binary string S . Perform R iterations on string S, where in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10. Find the Nth character (considering 0 based indexing) of the string after performing these R iterations. (See Examples for better understanding)


Example 1:

Input:
S = 101
R = 2 
N = 3
Output:
1
Explanation : 
After 1st iteration S becomes 100110.
After 2nd iteration, S = 100101101001
Now, we can clearly see that the character
at 3rd index is 1, and so the output.
Example

Input:
S = 11
R = 1 
N = 3
Output:
0
Explanation: 
After 1st iteration S becomes 1010.
Now, we can clearly see that the character
at 3rd index is 0, and so the output.


Codes Are:-
char nthCharacter(string S, int R, int N) {
       int i,j,k;
       i=0;j=0;
       k=1;
       while(i<R)
       {
           k*=2;
           i++;
       }
       i=0;
       while(i<S.size())
       {
           if(j+k<=N) j+=k;
           else break;
           i++;
       }
       string ans;N-=j;
       ans=S[i];
       while(R)
       {
           string temp;
           int i=0,n=ans.size();
           while(i<n)
           {
               temp+=ans[i];
               if(ans[i]=='1') temp+='0';
               else temp+='1';
               i++;
           }
           ans=temp;
           R--;
       }
       return ans[N];
    }

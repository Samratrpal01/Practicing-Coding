Given a string S, the task is to count number of subsequences of the form aibjck, where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.

Note: 
1. Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.
2.  For large test cases, output value will be too large, return the answer MODULO 10^9+7

 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "abbc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Subsequences are abc, abc and abbc.
â€‹
Example 2:

Input: 
S = "abcabc"
Output: 7
Explanation: Subsequences are abc, abc,
abbc, aabc abcc, abc and abc.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function fun() which takes the string S as input parameter and returns the number of subsequences which follows given condition.


Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of String).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1) .

Codes Are:-
int fun(string &s) {
        int mod = 1e9+7;
        int a = 0, ab = 0, abc = 0;
        for(auto& c: s) {
            if(c=='a') {
                a = (2*1LL*a  + 1)%mod;
            }
            else if(c=='b') {
                ab = (2*1LL*(ab)  + a)%mod;
            }
            else if(c=='c') {
                abc = (2*1LL*(abc)  + ab)%mod;
            }
        }
        return abc;
    }

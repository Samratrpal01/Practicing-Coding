Input:
N = 2
Output:
2
Explanation:
2 is represented as "10" in Binary.
As we see there's only one set bit
and it's in Position 2 and thus the
Output 2.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output:
-1
Explanation:
5 is represented as "101" in Binary.
As we see there's two set bits
and thus the Output -1.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findPosition() which takes an integer N as input and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)



Codes Are:-
 int findPosition(int N) {
        if((N==0 || N&(N-1))!=0)
        return -1;
        
        return log2(N)+1;
    }

Given a string s, remove all its adjacent duplicate characters recursively. 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "geeksforgeek"
Output: "gksforgk"
Explanation: 
g(ee)ksforg(ee)k -> gksforgkâ€‹

Example 2:

Input: 
S = "acaaabbbacdddd"
Output: "acac"
Explanation: 
ac(aaa)(bbb)ac(dddd) -> acac

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function remove() which takes the string S as input parameter and returns the resultant string.
Note: For some test cases, the resultant string would be an empty string. For that case, the function should return the empty string only.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

Codes Are:-
string remove(string s){
        string res = "";
        int n = s.length();
        
        int i=0;
        while(i<n){
            char c = s[i];
            int freq = 0;
            while(s[i] == c)
                freq++, i++;
            
            if(freq == 1)
                res += c;
        }
        
       if(res == s)
            return res;
        return remove(res);
    }

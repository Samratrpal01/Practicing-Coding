Consider a series of numbers composed of only digits 4 and 7. First few numbers in the series are 4, 7, 44, 47, 74, 77, 444, .. etc. Given a string N constructed by 4, 7 digit only, find position of this number in this series.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = "7"
Output: 2
Explanation: In the series 4 , 7 , 44 , 47...
7 is at second position.
 

Example 2:

Input: N = "444"
Output: 7
Explanation: In the series 4 , 7 , 44 ,
47 , 74 , 77 , 444 , 447... 444 is at 7th
position 
 

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findpos() which accepts a string N as input parameter and returns the position of that string in the given series.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(Length of given string)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Codes Are:-
unsigned long long int findpos(string no)
{
    unsigned long long int ans=0,n=no.size();
    unsigned long long int wt=1;
    while(n--)
    {
        if(no[n]=='4')
            ans+=wt*1;
        else
            ans+=wt*2;
        wt*=2;
    }
    
    return ans;
    
}

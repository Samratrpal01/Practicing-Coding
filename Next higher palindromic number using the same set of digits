Given a palindromic number N in the form of string. The task is to find the smallest palindromic number greater than N using the same set of digits as in N.

Example 1:

Input: 
N = "35453"
Output: 
53435
Explanation: Next higher palindromic 
number is 53435.
Example 2:

Input: N = "33"
Output: -1
Explanation: Next higher palindromic number 
does not exist.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function nextPalin() which takes the string N as input parameters and returns the answer, else if no such number exists returns "-1".

Expected Time Complexity: O(|N|log|N|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Codes Are:-
string nextPalin(string N) { 
        int n=N.size();
        if(n==3)
        return "-1";
        
        string half=N.substr(0,n/2);
        if(next_permutation(half.begin(),half.end()))
        {
            string ans=half;
            if(n&1)
            ans+=N[n/2];
            
            reverse(half.begin(),half.end());
            ans+=half;
            return ans;
        }
        return "-1";
    }

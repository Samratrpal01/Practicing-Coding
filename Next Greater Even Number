Given a positive integer X. The task is to find the smallest even number E such that
E > X and all digits in X and E are same.

Note: All the digits in X should be same with digits in E.

 

Example 1:

Input:
X = 34722641
Output:
34724126
Explanation:
Next greater number with same 
digits as in input is 34724126.

Example 2:

Input:
X = 111
Output:
-1
Explanation:
You can't rearrange the digits to get an answer.

Codes Are:-
long long getNextEven(string X)
    {
            string E = X;
    while(next_permutation(E.begin(), E.end())){
        if((E.back()-'0')%2 == 0)
            return stoll(E);
    }
    return -1;

        
        
    }

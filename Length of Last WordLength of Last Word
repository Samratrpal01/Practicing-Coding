Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"

Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

Cods Are:-
 int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        vector<string>v;
        stringstream str(s);
        string word;
        while(str>>word)
        {
            v.push_back(word);
        }
        
        int n=v.size()-1;
        return v[n].length();
    }
